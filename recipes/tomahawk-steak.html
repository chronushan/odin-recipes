<p>
	This grilled tomahawk steak recipe is a showstopper, ideal for sharing with
	friends and family. This reverse-seared steak is cooked to perfection with an
	unctuous compound butter filled with shallots, garlic, and chives. I like to
	use a Bluetooth-enabled meat thermometer to help me achieve the perfect
	medium-rare internal temperature.

<p>
	This is my favorite food overall. It isn't technically a complicated dish, but
	a good tomahawk steak with some chimichurri sauce is one of the best
	privilages that I have.
